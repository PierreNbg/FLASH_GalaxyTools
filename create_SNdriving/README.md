# Script to create an input file for the SNdriving routine

This routine determines random positions of SNe according to the radial gas surface density of a density profile.
We use convert the radial gas surface density to SFR surface density according to the Kennicutt-Schmidt law.
We then assume the formation of 1 massive star per 120 solar mass to convert the SFR surface density to a SNR.
Hereby, we use the annuli of the radial bins to determine the enclosed mass of the ring.
